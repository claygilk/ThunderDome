## Two Monsters Enter One Monster Leaves ##

This is a stripped down D&D 5e combat simulator that I am making for practice.

Other things to consider

Based on this [article](https://blog.markvincze.com/automated-portable-code-style-checking-in-net-core-projects/ )

```sh
dotnet add ThunderDome/ThunderDome/ThunderDome.csproj package StyleCop.Analyzers

After this, if you try to build your project, youâ€™ll immediately receive the violations in the form of compiler warnings.
